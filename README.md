# Cows & Bulls

## Introduction

The game of bulls and cows but with English words.

## How to Play

- The game will select a word and provide you with the number of alphabets in it.

- Your task is to guess the word by typing words that have the same number of alphabets as the selected word.

- As hints, the game will assign numbers to the letters "C" and "B".

- For example, if the game has selected the word "FISH" and tells you to guess 4, you might guess "POTS".

- When comparing your guess "POTS" with the selected word "FISH", you'll notice that "POTS" has the letter "S" from "FISH", but it's not in the correct place.

- In response, the game will provide a hint like "POTS C1B0", indicating that there is one correct letter (the "S") but it's not in the right position.

- Based on this feedback, you can make another guess. For instance, you might try "CASE".

- In this case, "CASE" has the letter "S" from "FISH", and it's in the correct position.

- The game will respond with a hint like "CASE C0B1", indicating that there are no correct letters in the correct position, but there is one correct letter in the wrong position.

- Keep guessing words by analyzing the hints provided until you correctly guess the word.

- Remember, words with multiple occurrences of letters are not allowed, and proper names are not allowed either.
